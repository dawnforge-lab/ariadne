/**
 * What a metric row is the answer FOR.
 *
 * `site` is the crawl as a whole and names nothing; the others each name one
 * thing in `scope_value`, and the pair is part of the metrics primary key.
 *
 *  - `page_type` — one cohort of pages, named by the crawler's own template
 *    detection (`derivePageType`), with the untyped pages under the `UNTYPED`
 *    sentinel.
 *  - `sitemap_doc` — one sitemap document, named by the URL it was fetched
 *    from. It exists because `sitemap.structure` has per-document rows and a
 *    sitemap document is NOT a page type: filing `https://site/sitemap-1.xml`
 *    under `page_type` would put a URL where every other reader of that scope
 *    expects a template name, and every consumer that groups the two scopes
 *    together — the report, the agent, a future `page_type` join — would read
 *    it as a cohort of pages that does not exist. A scope is a claim about what
 *    a row counts, so a new kind of row gets a new scope rather than a
 *    borrowed one (hard rule 7).
 *
 * Closed, like `RuleCategory`, and for the same reason: the runner deletes and
 * rewrites metric rows by (crawl, metric, scope, scope value), so a one-off
 * spelling is a row nothing recomputes. `METRIC_SCOPES` below is the same list
 * as a value, because the runner checks a rule's return at the JavaScript
 * boundary where the type system has seen nothing.
