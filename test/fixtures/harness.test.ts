/**
 * The end-to-end net.
 *
 * One local HTTP site, crawled once by the REAL crawler, judged once by the
 * REAL rule runner, asserted from the `issues` table. Nothing here stubs a
 * fetch, hand-builds a `pages` row, or calls a rule directly: if the analyzer
 * stops extracting a signal, or the writer stops persisting it, or a rule stops
 * reading it, this file fails, and none of the unit suites would.
 *
 * The crawl and the rule run happen once, in `beforeAll`. Every assertion below
 * reads the same result, so adding a fixture costs a page fetch, not a crawl.
